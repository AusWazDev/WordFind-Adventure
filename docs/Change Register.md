| CR-07 | Remove dead `spelling: 'Spelling Bee'` entry from `GameHeader.jsx` modeLabels | ✅ Completed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-08 | Remove stale `REQUIRES_ONLINE` gate for Word Association (works fully offline after CR-04) | ✅ Completed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-09 | Update `HowToPlayModal` — Mystery Word added, Spelling Bee removed, clue description fixed, hint penalties documented | ✅ Completed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-10 | Offline monetisation — 12 free hints on first launch; interstitial ad skipped offline; HintModal buttons greyed out offline | ✅ Completed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-11 | Remove dead code in `gameUtils.jsx` — `pickCategoryBonusWord`, `tryPlaceWordDenseProtected`, `hasEmptyNonProtectedCell` | ✅ Completed | `3aba629` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-12 | Settings page refresh — add Master level, all 23 categories, back button, auto-save indicator, remove Theme stub, rename Delete Account → Reset Game Data | ✅ Completed | `3aba629` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-13 | Daily Challenge overhaul — fixed viewport layout matching Game.jsx, orientation support, board sizing, remove SpellingBeeWordList, add mystery_word support, fix hintCell→hintCells, fix hints hardcoded to 3; replace 2 spelling templates in DailyChallengeUtils; fix MODE_LABELS in DailyChallengeCard | ✅ Completed | `7470c5c` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-14 | Delete orphaned `SpellingBeeWordList.jsx` — no longer imported anywhere after CR-13 | ✅ Completed | `3561220` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-15 | Reduce interstitial ad frequency — change trigger from every 3 game **starts** to every 6 **completed** games. `AD_FREQUENCY` changed to 6 in `Home.jsx`; `saveProgress` in `Game.jsx` now increments `games_completed_count` in localStorage; `handleSelectLevel` reads `games_completed_count` and `last_ad_completed_at` to determine when to show the ad, avoiding double-triggering at the same threshold. | ✅ Completed | `caa3330` | Mar 2026 |
| CR-16 | Collapsible word list — word list panel is **collapsed by default** during play, showing a slim pill bar ("Words to Find · 3/8 ▾"). Player taps the bar to expand the full list; taps again to re-collapse. The progress pill turns primary-colour when all words are found. Auto-expands when the bonus word hunt begins (so all ticked words are visible) and on non-bonus victory. Landscape sidebar and all three word list variants (Standard/Audio, Anagram, Association) are unaffected — collapse wrapper lives entirely in `Game.jsx`'s portrait layout, keeping rollback trivial. | ✅ Completed | `6a45e9e` | Apr 2026 |
| CR-17 | Responsive grid sizing — board `maxHeight` in portrait mode increases from `min(55dvh, 100vw)` to `min(75dvh, 100vw)` when the word list is collapsed (CR-16 default state). Board measurement effect re-fires on collapse toggle, so the grid recalculates to fill the extra vertical space. When the word list is expanded, board reverts to `55dvh` cap and word list panel takes `flex: 1`. Landscape layout unchanged. | ✅ Completed | `6a45e9e` | Apr 2026 |
| CR-18 | App icon design — interactive HTML5 Canvas mockup (`docs/icon/icon-mockup.html`) and final 1024px master PNG (`docs/icon/soundfind-icon-d.png`). Concept D: diagonal split with a 7×7 word grid in the top-right triangle (fading toward the diagonal), SOUND and FIND spelled in teal-highlighted cells along the two anti-diagonals, and a rounded iOS-style teal speaker in the top-left corner with gold accent waves radiating toward the grid. Final locked settings: grid opacity 38%, grid fade 60%, wave reach 72%, wave start gap 10%, speaker size 20%, speaker length 150%, bottom bleed 40%, top bleed 47%, speaker position x=15% y=15%. | ✅ Completed | `83db442` | Apr 2026 |
| CR-19 | Splash screen design — interactive HTML5 Canvas mockup (`docs/icon/splash-mockup.html`) for the app launch splash screen. Shows the CR-18 icon centred on a deep dark background with "SoundFind" in white/violet below and tagline "Find the words. Feel the sound." Fade in (400ms) → hold → fade to Home (300ms) animation sequence with Preview button. Final locked settings: icon size 40%, icon vertical position 40%, name spacing 10%, tagline "Find the words. Feel the sound.", background deep dark near-black, grid overlay opacity 10%, hold duration 2000ms (total 2.7s). | ✅ Completed | `48501a2` | Apr 2026 |
| CR-21 | Brand alignment — WelcomeScreen and HowToPlayModal updated to match the dark splash/icon design language. WelcomeScreen background changed from purple gradient to deep dark near-black (`#0f0e1a → #1a1830`). Volume2 placeholder icon replaced with `public/icon.png` (72px, iOS-style border-radius). "Find" text colour changed from `amber-400` to `violet-400`. Audio Challenge feature card changed from amber/orange gradient to teal/indigo to match the icon's speaker colour. Top-left decorative blob changed from amber to violet. HowToPlayModal featured-slide header (Audio Challenge) changed from amber/orange to teal/indigo gradient — all slides now use the same violet/indigo family. `Volume2` unused import removed from `WelcomeScreen.jsx`. | ✅ Completed | — | Apr 2026 |
| CR-20 | Splash screen implementation — `src/components/game/SplashScreen.jsx` built from CR-19 approved design. Deep dark near-black gradient background, icon from `public/icon.png` at 40vmin with iOS-style border-radius, "Sound" (white) + "Find" (violet-400) name, tagline "Find the words. Feel the sound.", three violet loader dots. Framer Motion sequence: fade in 400ms → hold 2000ms → fade out 300ms → `onComplete` callback. Wired into `App.jsx` via `showSplash` state rendered above all routes. `public/icon.png` added (1024px master PNG from CR-18). `index.html` favicon updated from emoji to `icon.png`. | ✅ Completed | `4b4c408` | Apr 2026 |

## Defects Log

| DEF # | Description | Status | Fix Commit | Date |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|------|
| DEF-01 | Word list displayed words in lowercase | ✅ Fixed | `a80a6ae` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-02 | Words 100% formed from already-placed letters incorrectly included in word list | ✅ Fixed | `a80a6ae` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-03 | "Homophone" label showing under RAIN in non-audio Mystery Word mode | ✅ Fixed | `ef74286` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-04 | Category name truncated in compact header ("Mystery Word ·...") | ✅ Fixed | `ef74286` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-05 | Non-category words appearing in themed Mystery Word filler (e.g. RUIN/SAD in Food game) | ✅ Fixed | `a80a6ae` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-06 | HowToPlay nav buttons appeared permanently hovered/pressed | ✅ Fixed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-07 | HowToPlay Other Modes tile titles incorrectly inherited dark mode text colour | ✅ Fixed | `129f64f` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-08 | Category and Level selector tile titles incorrectly inherited dark mode text colour (same class as DEF-07); icon and title now displayed inline | ✅ Fixed | `6931b72` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-09 | WelcomeScreen feature grid references removed game mode "Spelling Bee" (🐝) — replaced with Mystery Word (🔍) | ✅ Fixed | `ce06d61` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-10 | Audio Challenge word list dots (• • • • •) wrapping onto second line in narrow containers — added `whitespace-nowrap` to dot span in `WordList.jsx` | ✅ Fixed | `0be8117` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-11 | Audio Challenge using robotic Microsoft voice instead of Google US English — `getVoices()` was caching only local (Microsoft) voices on first synchronous call before Chrome's `voiceschanged` fired with full list; removed early-return short-circuit in `voiceUtils.jsx` | ✅ Fixed | `b2ee77f` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-12 | Audio Challenge voice quality poor on Safari/Mac — investigated on Mac (29 Mar). Safari returns 223 voices synchronously; no enhanced voices installed on test Mac. Scoring algorithm correctly selects Karen (en-AU, score 105). No code fix required — quality limited by macOS installed voices. iOS beta testers will have Karen (Enhanced) pre-installed and will get high-quality audio automatically. | ✅ Closed (no code change) | — | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-17 | Mystery word selected from wrong category — e.g. INTERSTELLAR (space) appearing in a Food game. Filler loop ran past all valid food word lengths, leaving K=11 which matched a space category bonus pair. Fix: pre-compute `validMysteryLengths` from the category word pool; filler loop now stops as soon as empty cell count hits a valid length, ensuring `findMysteryWord` always finds an in-category match. Cross-category fallback retained as true last resort. | ✅ Fixed | `80c20d0` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-18 | In Mystery Word mode, words from the regular word list could have all their letters already present in other selected words (e.g. IRAN in a Countries game where I, R, A, N all appear elsewhere), making them trivially deducible. The unique-letter preference rule from DEF-16 was applied only to the mystery word selection, not to `pickWords`. Fix: added `preferUniqueLetters` flag to `pickWords`; in Mystery Word mode, words are greedily selected so each contributes at least one letter not already covered by the other selected words. Falls back to any valid word only if all 26 letters are already exhausted. Word pool remains the same themed category pool as Standard mode. | ✅ Fixed | `ea5f433` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-16 | Mystery word could be selected with all letters already present in regular word list (e.g. PIE when P, I, E all used by other words) — `findMysteryWord` had no preference for words contributing unique letters. Fix: build `placedLetters` set from all placed words; pass to `findMysteryWord` which now prefers candidates containing at least one letter not in that set, falling back to any valid word only if no unique-letter candidate exists at the target length. | ✅ Fixed | `80c20d0` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-15 | Level selector Medium tile appears permanently hovered — selected state used `shadow-lg shadow-violet-200` which is visually indistinguishable from the hover shadow; replaced with `ring-2 ring-violet-300 ring-offset-1` to give a clear selection indicator distinct from hover. | ✅ Fixed | `860b23a` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-14 | Highlighting a substring of a longer word incorrectly accepted as finding the shorter word (e.g. highlighting CAKE within PANCAKE's grid positions marked CAKE as found). `checkWord` matched on spelling only — added position guard in `handleWordFound` to compare selected cells against `wordPositions[word]`; rejects match if cells don't align exactly. | ✅ Fixed | `ac1f345` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-13 | App crashes when clicking Next Level after completing a level — `handleNextLevel` used `window.location.assign()` causing a hard reload to `/Game` which Vercel serves as 404 (no SPA routing configured). Fix: added `vercel.json` with SPA rewrites; replaced `window.location.assign()` with React Router `navigate()`; updated `useEffect` deps to `[level, mode, category]` so game re-initialises on client-side URL change. | ✅ Fixed | `2eb2b4e` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-21 | Bonus word input auto-focuses on iOS, triggering the keyboard and scrolling/zooming the viewport to the input field — obscuring the grid the player needs to read the gold letters from. Two fixes in `Game.jsx`: (1) added `autoFocus={false}` to the input so the keyboard only appears when the player deliberately taps the field; (2) changed `fontSize` from 14 to 16px — iOS Safari auto-zooms any input with font-size < 16px, causing the viewport scale change. | ✅ Fixed | `660d991` | Apr 2026 |
| DEF-22 | Splash screen (CR-20) faded in from transparent, causing the Home screen to flash briefly before the splash covered it. Root cause: `SplashScreen.jsx` used `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}` on the whole overlay div, so for the 400ms fade-in the Home page was visible underneath. Fix: split into two motion elements — outer overlay starts at `opacity: 1` (immediately blocks Home), inner content div fades in from `opacity: 0` to give the smooth entrance effect. | ✅ Fixed | `82778c0` | Apr 2026 |
| DEF-23 | Settings "Reset Game Data" called `localStorage.clear()`, wiping `hints_remaining` and restoring the default 12 free hints on next launch — players could exploit this to get unlimited free hints. Fix: replaced `localStorage.clear()` with selective key removal (`wf_progress`, `wf_settings`, `wf_daily`, `wf_welcome_seen`, `games_completed_count`, `last_ad_completed_at`). Before clearing, reads and preserves `hints_remaining` (current balance) and `ads_removed` (IAP flag). Restores both after the reset. Toast updated to confirm hints and purchases are preserved. | ✅ Fixed | — | Apr 2026 |
| DEF-20 | Mystery word from wrong category — e.g. SINGULARITY (space bonus pair) appearing in a Sports game. DEF-17 fixed the *filler overshooting* case, but a second case was missed: when the filler word pool exhausts before landing on a valid category mystery length, the remainder K has no in-category match, and `findMysteryWord` falls through to cross-category words. Root cause: every category had gaps in its word length coverage (e.g. sports had no 11-letter words). Fix: expanded all 14 `wordLists` arrays to cover every length from 4–12 — adding 137 new themed words total (e.g. sports gains PARASAILING, KITESURFING, CHAMPIONSHIP; countries gains AUSTRALIA, MADAGASCAR, SWITZERLAND). With full 4–12 coverage, the filler loop's `validMysteryLengths` stop-check always finds a matching category length, and `findMysteryWord` always returns a themed word. Also improves game variety for regular players. | ✅ Fixed | `cffea23` | Mar 2026 |
| DEF-19 | Touch scroll and pull-to-refresh conflict with word selection on mobile web. React 17+ registers touch listeners as passive by default, so `e.preventDefault()` in synthetic event handlers (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`) is silently ignored — the browser still scrolls/pull-to-refreshes through the game board during word selection. Fix: added a `useEffect` in `GameBoard.jsx` that attaches direct non-passive DOM listeners (`{ passive: false }`) for `touchstart` and `touchmove` on the grid element, ensuring `preventDefault()` is honoured. Also added `overscrollBehavior: 'none'` to the board container to block pull-to-refresh at the CSS level. | ✅ Fixed | `caa3330` | Mar 2026 |
